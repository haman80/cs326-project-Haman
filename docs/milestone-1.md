# Application Idea
Movie Buddy allows users to make a personal account on the websites. Moreover, user can keep track of the movies that they have watched and the movies that they plan to watch. Moreover, Movie Buddy will use a publicly available movie dataset with the help of a machine learning algorithm in order to make recommendations to the user based on their favorite movies.
# Functionality
For each user, Movie Buddy maintains a list of the user's watched movies in addition to a rating on how much the user enjoyed that movie. Using that list or a subset of that list (this option is chosen by the user), Movie Buddy will make use of a machine learning algorithm and a publicly available movie dataset in order to recommend a list of new movies to the user. Finally, Movie Buddy will also provide a To-Be-Watched List for each user, so that the users can keep track of the movies they wish to watch in the future.
